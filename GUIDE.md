# Overview

My program will be a text messaging app that helps facilitate a more personal recruitment process for students at Vanderbilt. The app will target some key issues students typically face during the recruiting process. These issue include finding peers to network with, gaining insights on the interview experience, and identifying people willing to help. Today many students use LinkedIn for building their network and reaching out to peers with similar interests, however, connections made through LinkedIn tend to be very inorganic. My app will try to address this problem by only having willing people opt-in to being a resource.

From a high-level my app will utilize a text messaging bot that will allow users to first identify as either a student and/or a guide. From the student perspective they will be able to ask the bots if there are any available guides within a certain job industry or aligned with a certain company. From there students would then request to be connected to a guide that is available or be informed that the system currently has no guides in that area.

From the guide perspective, they will be able to opt-in to the system and input whatever industries or companies they would like to help students with. It is important to note that not only will this app ask guides where they have previously been employed, but it will also ask which companies they have done interviews with before in order to offer students insights into what that process looked like.
