# Overview

This program is a text messaging bot that helps facilitate a more personal recruitment process for students at Vanderbilt. The app targets some key issues students typically face during the recruiting process. These issue include finding peers to network with, gaining insights on the interview experience, and identifying people willing to help. Today many students use LinkedIn for building their network and reaching out to peers with similar interests, however, connections made through LinkedIn tend to be very inorganic. My app will try to address this problem by only having willing people opt-in to being a resource.

This app uses a text messaging bot that allows users to register themselves as a resource or give students the ability to ask resources for help. From the student perspective, you can ask the bots if there are any resources aligned with a certain company. From there you can request to be connected to a resource or be informed that the system currently has no resources in that area. From the guide perspective, you will be able to opt-in to the system and input whatever companies you would like to help students with. 

It is important to note that not only does this app ask resources where they have previously been employed, but it also asks which companies they have done interviews with before in order to offer students insights into what that process looked like.
