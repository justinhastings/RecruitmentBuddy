# Recruitment Buddy

My program will be a text messaging app that helps facilitate a more personal recruitment process for students at Vanderbilt. The app will target some key issues students typically face during the recruiting process. These issue include finding peers to network with, gaining insights on the interview experience, and identifying people willing to help. Today many students use LinkedIn for building their network and reaching out to peers with similar interests, however, connections made through LinkedIn tend to be very inorganic. My app will try to address this problem by only having willing people opt-in to being a resource.

From a high-level my app will utilize a text messaging bot that will allow users to first identify as either a student and/or a guide. From the student perspective they will be able to ask the bots if there are any available guides within a certain job industry or aligned with a certain company. From there students would then request to be connected to a guide that is available or be informed that the system currently has no guides in that area. 

From the guide perspective, they will be able to opt-in to the system and input whatever industries or companies they would like to help students with. It is important to note that not only will this app ask guides where they have previously been employed, but it will also ask which companies they have done interviews with before in order to offer students insights into what that process looked like.

# Answers:

## Question 1:

Challenging. I've been pursuing a job in Real Estate Development/Management and Construction Management but have not done a ton of networking from Career Center standpoint. Most networking has been through Vanderbilt alumni on LinkedIn. Not many recruiting events through the career fair.

Currently I look on LinkedIn and Doreways.

I felt like it was frustrating and competitive. Thats pretty much it.

# Requirements:

Make the job search experience easier and more natural.

# Development Approach:

Allow users the ability to ask employees, previous employees, and people who have interviewed for their contact information and guidance.

## Question 2:

Mostly through connections with professors and the Civil Engineering Department. Also LinkedIn.

Doreways and Older Friends

I mostly find out about opportunities from Doreways and I also looked on LinkedIn.

## Question 3:

They were helpful with resume and cover letter stuff. I don’t think they do a bad job but I wish they had more real estate outreach especially living in a place like Nashville where there is such so much real estate opportunity. Having only two firms at the career fair was a bummer considering there are so many firms that also recruit at other schools.

I haven’t really used the career center that much, only Doreways. So I guess no? But it’s kind of on me.

They were okay. I went there once, but I had an offer before going there. They didn't really help much with getting my job.

# Question 4:

70% LinkedIn 15% Friends and Parents at Vanderbilt 15% Professors

I ask my friends if they know anyone who has interviewed there and I also look on Linkedin

I don't find people. I didn't really network.

# Question 5:

I like that it is personal. It was nice to talk freely with Vanderbilt alum organically.

I like how it’s easy to apply using the same place where I look for opportunities.

It's easy to see who is doing on-campus recruiting.

# Question 6:

It's really slow. Since its not campus recruiting my process is drawn out over multiple semesters. There’s way less structure. 

I wish it were easier to filter jobs by application deadline on Doreways.

There are a lot of random jobs that I don't think people would ever be interested in. I don't know why they are even listed on the site. 

# Question 7: 

I’ve felt pretty prepared but that through advice of friends. Primarily people who have done it before. I did not go to the career center and maybe I should have. Being a tour guide so the tell me about yourself question is something I have rehearsed. Real Estate club has also helped with some of the technical aspects of the interview. 

I felt pretty prepared, didn’t think I was blindsided by anything.

I felt like I was prepared a medium amount. I knew the types of questions I would be asked but I don't know that I feel like I was completely equipped to answer them.

# Question 8:

Naturally nervous but pretty confident. I have only had first round so far. 

Nervous but ready to rock and roll baby.

Nervous and Anxious.

# Question 9:

N/A

N/A, but I think what helps getting an interview is having someone who worked there previously or know someone who works there to connect with someone who can help you get your foot in the door.

A higher GPA. Networking. Yea. 

# Question 10:

More prepared. I don’t think they would have gone much differently. Maybe technically wise it would have helped. I always talked to people who had previously don't some sort of real estate interview.

I could have had better insight into how the interview process looked.

I probably would have had more information about the questions. I probably would have felt more prepared and less nervous because I feel like its better to have someone to talk to rather than reading posts on Glassdoor or similar websites.
